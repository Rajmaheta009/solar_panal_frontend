                        <!--<p>Grace,  a solar EPC service provider company believes in advancement with the time, now  has come with a bifacial solar panel, a new innovation emerging in the rooftop  solar industry, which claims to amplify the solar power generation as compared  to traditional solar panels. The ingenious Bifacial module  is designed to capture solar energy from both sides that is harvesting  almost 30% more power at a time, while installing on a highly reflective  surface (TPO roof / ground with light colored stone), making it ideal for the  project site with the high albedo (deserts with sand, white roofs, gravel).</p>
        <p>Bifacial solar modules are designed and developed  in strict adherence to the international quality standards that promises for  the efficient and unfailing performance even under the harsh environments. </p>
        <p>We  are based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, provide a complete EPC solution with the  desired type of solar panel available with us in India as well as foreign  countries at the best price; we already have undertaken multiple solar EPC  projects in different countries and envision expanding the same.  </p>-->
                        <p>Grace Solar associated with manufacturing bi-facial solar panel of ADANI SOLAR with a firm commitment to quality.</p>
                        <p>Bi facial solar modules has many advantages in compare to traditional solar panels. Power can be generate from both sides of a bi facial module, that increases total energy generation. They are often more durable because both sides
                            are UV resistant, and potential-induced degradation (PID) concerns are reduced when the bifacial module is frame less. Balance of system (BOS) costs are also reduced when more power can be produced from bifacial panels in a
                            smaller array footprint.</p>
                        <p>The bifacial solar cell efficiency can be as high as 27% When bifacial modules are installed on a highly reflective surface (like a white TPO roof or on the ground with light-colored stones), some bifacial module manufacturers
                            claim up to a 25-30% increase in production just from the extra energy produced from the rear.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bifacial modules come in many designs :</strong></p>
                        <p>1.Some are framed while others are frame less.</p>
                        <p>2.Some are dual-glass, and others use clear back sheets.</p>
                        <p>Maximum use monocrystalline cells, but there are polycrystalline designs. The one thing that is constant is that power is produced from both sides. True bifacial modules have contacts/bus bars on both the front and back sides of
                            their cells.</p>

                        <h3>Major Benefits of Half Cut Solar Panel:</h3>
                        <div class="point">1. Lower Resistive Losses</div>
                        <p>Basically, in solar panel the resistive power losses occur when electrical current passed through the cell interconnection. While these solar cells cut in half, the current is divided. This decreased current in turns lower resistive
                            losses and improves the performance. This cut cell solar module design claims to increase the output by 2.5% over a full sized cell and 9 to 10 W per panel.</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="point">2. Higher Shade Tolerance</div>
                        <p>This half cut solar panels have six string design over the three string design of traditional one, hence is more resistance to the effects of partial shade on the panel. So when there is any partial shade on a panel, because of
                            any leaves, branches, bird poop or dust/ debris, the shaded area will only affect a sixth of the entire panel power output, rather than one third of the output.</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="point">3. Better Durability</div>
                        <p>The six string design mitigates the cells size this in turns reduce the stress on each cell interconnection expansion and contraction as the panel heats and cools each day. Further, the small cell size bends less, hence less prone
                            to cracking as well as it also slash downs the hot spot temperature, which ultimately lowers the risk of damaging the panel.</p>
