                    <p>Converting solar energy into electrical energy by PV installations is the most recognized way to use solar energy.Solar PV modules are a result of combination of PV cells to increase their power, are highly reliable, durable and low
                        noise devices to produce electricity. PV cell has a lifetime of more than thirty years. Most solar cells are produced from silicon, which is non-toxic and is found in abundance in the earth's crust.</p>
                    <p>A typical photovoltaic cell efficiency is about 15%, which means it can convert 1/6 of solar energy into electricity.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Solar Panels appear to be the new thing in cognizant energy nowadays and with such a significant number of trendy investment opportunities, it is difficult to know whether putting resources into something is truly going to “set
                            aside you huge amounts of cash.” However, setting aside cash through decreasing the cost on your power bill by cutting down the amount of energy you use is no accident. Solar Panels enable you to set aside cash by creating
                            a natural source of energy that can control your home.</p>
                        <p>Electricity is getting to be costly as time passes and more individuals are getting keen on utilizing solar energy to meet their electricity needs. The expense of a <strong>rooftop solar PV system</strong> relies upon the capacity
                            it serves incentives/subsidies available. It ought to be noticed that all <strong>solar PV systems</strong> work by coordinating the voltage from some other source. Accordingly the system has to be incorporated with the grid,
                            battery reinforcement, or a diesel generator.</p>

                        <h2 style=" float:left;color:#404040;">WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF SOLAR PANELS?</h2>
                        <div class="clearfix"></div>
                        <p>There are three types of Solar Panels accessible with us such as monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film panels. Each type of panels has its own unique benefits and the solar panel type best suited for your installation
                            will depend on factors specific to your own property and desired system characteristics.</p>
                        <h3>Monocrystalline Solar Panel</h3>
                        <p>The solar panel which is made of monocrystalline silicon is the purest one and easily recognized by their unvarying dark look and the curved ends. The offered solar panel has a high power output, occupy less space, and last the
                            longest. Another advantage to consider is that they tend to be slightly less affected by high temperatures compared to polycrystalline panels.</p>
                        <h3>Polycrystalline Solar Panel</h3>
                        <p>This type of solar panel can be quickly indentified due to their square shape, its angles are not cut and it has a blue, speckled look. The offered Polycrystalline Solar Panel is manufactured by melting raw silicon, which is a
                            faster and cheaper process. However, the differences between mono- and polycrystalline types of solar panels are not so significant and the choice will strongly depend on your specific situation. The first option offers slightly
                            higher space efficiency at a slightly higher price but power outputs is basically the same.</p>
                        <h3>Thin-film panels</h3>
                        <p>Thin film solar panels are made of the thin film solar cell materials. These devices are made from physically flexible solar cells and are designed to generate electrical energy by converting light energy into electricity. There
                            are several types of thin film solar panels available today made with various technologies. A major advantage of thin film solar lies in its flexibility, which helps it being installed on curved as well as flat surfaces and
                            in building-integrated photovoltaics.</p>

                        <h2 style=" float:left;color:#404040;">PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS COST / PV PANELS COST</h2>
                        <div class="clearfix"></div>
                        <p>The <strong>cost of the Photovoltaic System Cost</strong> has been reduced in price by 40% approximately as a result of falling manufacturing costs and increased competition in the market. Moreover one can buy either locally manufactured
                            modules or internationally imported ones from the international companies. In a major initiative, Govt. of India has prepared a plan to scale-up development of Grid-Connected Solar Power, under the National Solar Mission, from
                            20,000 MW of grid-connected solar to 1lac MW by 2022, giving high emphasis to grid-connected <b>Rooftop Solar Power Projects</b>.</p>
                        <p>To maximize the return from the <strong>solar PV installation</strong>, you need to use as much of the electricity that is produce in resident as possible. In the most basic terms, if you use the electricity produced in the resident,
                            then you don’t need to buy it from any energy provider (a saving of around 12.5p/kWh). If you export it, you only get paid a fraction of this – but this isn’t actually the main reason to export the electricity. You can also
                            get payment from the government for every unit of energy you generate, and for sending what you don’t use to the National Grid.</p>
